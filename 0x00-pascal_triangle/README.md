# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python as part of the **ALX Interview Preparation** series. The task involves generating a list of lists that represents Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn and reinforce concepts such as:
- Python list operations, including list comprehensions.
- Functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- Efficient algorithms for mathematical computations.
- Indexing and slicing lists.
- Returning structured data as output from functions.

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.x.
- Follow Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
- Code must be executable without errors or exceptions for valid inputs.
- The `pascal_triangle` function must be implemented in a file named `0-pascal_triangle.py`.

## Function Prototype

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of rows of Pascal's Triangle to generate.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle.
    """
